## Research Data?!?

> the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: Preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues.

## Projects Are Processes

* Things change <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Handling and anticipating change is management <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Research often involves data <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## (Why) Is This Funny?

<blockquote class="r-fit-text">
<p>I will store all data on at least one, and possibly up to 50, hard drives
in my lab. The directory structure will be custom, not self-explanatory, and
in no way documented or described. Students working with the data will be
encouraged to make their own copies and modify them as they please, in order
to ensure that no one can ever figure out what the actual real raw data
is.</p>

Backups will rarely, if ever, be done.
</blockquote>

## Managed Data Lasts

* Helps with reproducibility and replicability
* Can follow FAIR (Findable, Acceesible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles
* Assists future you with understanding what you were doing

---

## Managed Data Are the Rules

* 2011: NSF, NOAA, and NEH require DMPs
* 2012: NIH joins
* 2014: DOE
* 2015: NASA

## A DMP Answers:

* What types of data will we be capturing or creating? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* What formats will we use to save our data? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* How will we describe the data? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Who has access to and how do they access the data? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* How FAIR is the data? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Who manages the data’s integrity? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Writing a DMP

* Consult with
  [RDS](https://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services.html)
* Read Columbia-provided [DMPs](https://research.columbia.edu/writing-data-management-plan)
* Use the [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/)!
